Track fire plot flowchart explanation:

This diagram represents the data processing and visualization workflow used to analyze the temporal and spatial interactions between bird movements and fire events. Starting from the left, the workflow begins with the ingestion of multiple CSV files containing raw data, which are consolidated into a primary dataset. From this dataset, specific timestamps are extracted, focusing on those associated with fire events occurring within the last hour.
These timestamps are then used to define start_date and end_date intervals, which serve as the basis for filtering the data. The filtered_data set is created by applying these temporal filters, ensuring that only relevant data within these intervals is retained. This filtered dataset is then used to generate various derived data structures, including vertical line data (vline_data), fire latitude combinations, and overlap points where bird locations coincide with fire events.
The final stage of the workflow involves generating two key visualizations: a spatial plot and a latitude plot. The spatial plot depicts the geographic trajectories of both birds and fire events, highlighting areas of overlap. The latitude plot focuses on the relationship between latitude and the occurrence of fire events, providing a complementary perspective. Together, these plots facilitate a comprehensive analysis of the spatiotemporal dynamics between bird movements and fire occurrences, using color scales and shapes to differentiate between various data points and categories.
The white arrows within the diagram trace the logical flow of data through these processes, illustrating the sequential application of filtering, transformation, and plotting functions across the dataset.
